The task I have been assigned is to create a visual dungeon out of a input Dictionary. 
A Dictionary in Python is a set of key, value pairs. A dictionary that might be input to my task could look like:

dungeonDictionary = {
	"Room1": [[0,0], [0,1], [1,1], [0,1]]
	"Room2": [[..],[..],[..],[..]]
	"Zombie": [0.5, 0.5]
}

This dictionary has to be converted into a visual dungeon, and perhaps fed into another AI model which helps generate items and images in the map.

Note that popular tabletop games use 80 pixels per square. Furthermore, walls through a square make movement difficult and are largely on edges for gaming reasons. CREATURES should always be put in the center of their square. Objects should likewise.

I need to have a list of all the possible png images that can be displayed by this program.

The following is a map of the objects that can be displayed:
Theme		Rooms		Creatures	Objects		Walls		Floors
|Castle		|Bedroom	|Horse		|Suit of Armor	|Stone		|Wood
|		|Throne Room	|Knight		|Church Pew	|Window		|Stone
|Temple		|Chapel		|Priest		|		|		|

I need to specify all of the items and their size for the genetic algorithm.
Once I have done that, I need some way of displaying them using python.
